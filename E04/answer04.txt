- We are using adders with two input ports which requires a power of 
two adders so that every output can be directed to new layer of adders.
If the count is not pre-defined, it's difficult to instantiate the 
number of adders to fulfill the calculation.

- Structural is a structure of sequential component 'adder' which operates
as a combinational componnent. The structural does not use clock and 
register directly but only through its subcomponents.

- In VHDL, we separate the bigger task into smaller ones which can be 
implemented as a simple entity, and then instantiating them as 
components in a composing entity.
