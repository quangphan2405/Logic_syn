We corrected the code by replacing line 67 with "next_state <= init;"

We introduced a new bug by replacing line 64 with "IF (to_integer(UNSIGNED(keys_in)) = second_c) THEN". Testbench failed with error "Lock opens with a wrong sequence!".

With force-commands one can generate some arbitrary inputs on simulation time. 
With testbenches it is easier to benerate inputs which are easy to repeat. One
can also create self-checking tests with tesbenches utilizing assertions.

There are 5 states in the testbench state machine.
